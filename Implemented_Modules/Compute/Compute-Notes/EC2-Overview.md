# What is Amazon EC2?
Computing capacity provisiioned on the AWS cloud to be used as scalable alternative to investing in hardware up front.
You can use amazon EC2 to launch as many servers as needed, configure security and networking, and manage storage,
Amazon EC2 enables you to scale up and down to adapt to changes in resource requirements needed in order to keep
operating costs lows and applications running smoothly.

## Features of Amazon EC2

• Virtual computing environments known as instances.  
• Preconfigured templates for instance (AMIs).   
• Various configurations of CPU, memory, and storage depending on the instance type selected.   
• Storage volumes for temporay storage or persistant storage know Elastic Block storage (EBS).   
• Multiple physical location for instance, such as instances and EBS volumes.   
• Firewall that enables you to specify the protocols, ports, and IP address used to reach you instances.   
• Static IP addresses.   
• Metadata, known as tags.   
• Virtual networks that are logically isolated from the rest of the AWS.

## EC2 Pricing

There are multiple ways of purchasing EC2 instances with the following options
• On-Deman Instances: Pay by the second. For the instances you launch.   
• Spot Instances: Request unused EC2 instances.   
• Reserved Instances: Commitment to instances with consistent configuration, instance type, and region for a term of 1 to 3 years.   
• Capacity Reservations: Reserve capacity for you instances in a specific availability zone for any duration.   
• Saving Plans: Commitment to instances with a consistent amount of usage ($USD/hr) for a term of 1 to 3 years.   
• Dedicated Instances: Pay by the hour, for instances that run on single tenant hardware.   
• Dedicated Hosts: Paid physical host fully dedicated to running instances. Bring existing per-socket, per-core, per-VM software licences.

## Instance Types

The Instance type, when launching an instance, determines the hardware of the host computer used. Each instance type
offers different compute, memory, and storage capabilities. As well, instance types are grouped into instance families
based on these capabilities.
